# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is our end semester project for Second semester. This project visually impliments how a sorting algorithm works and helps us to visualize about various sorting algorithm. As for this project we have specifically choose three algorithms which are listed below:

- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Tim Sort

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a graphical tool designed to illustrate how different sorting algorithms work. This project leverages ImGui for the user interface, SFML for rendering graphics, and ImGui-SFML for seamless integration between the two. The combination of these technologies provides a responsive and interactive experience, making it easy for users to observe and understand the inner workings of various sorting algorithms.

## Installation

### **Prerequisites**
- C++ compiler
- make
- Cmake
- Sfml
```bash
#Debian Based systems:
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install make
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

#Arch Based systems:
sudo pacman -S gcc 
sudo pacman -S sfml
```
### **Steps**

- Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/ManogyaDahal/Sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
```

- Getting into project directory:
```bash
cd Sorting-algorithm-visualizer
```

- To build the code
```bash
make
```
After these steps, the project should be built and ready to run.
### **Running**

To run the code you can hit
```bash
./Algoviz

#Or you can run:
./build/bin/main
```
Then the code should be running.

## Features
- User input or Random value generator 
- Adjusting the speed
- Swap information viewer in realtime
- Time complexity for each sort is shown
- User has option to choose Three sort
