# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is our end semester project for Second semester. This project visually impliments how a sorting algorithm works and helps us to visualize about various sorting algorithm. As for this project we have specifically choose three algorithms which are listed below:

- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Tim Sort

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a graphical tool designed to illustrate how different sorting algorithms work. This project leverages ImGui for the user interface, SFML for rendering graphics, and ImGui-SFML for seamless integration between the two. The combination of these technologies provides a responsive and interactive experience, making it easy for users to observe and understand the inner workings of various sorting algorithms.

## Installation

### **Prerequisites**
- Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.

### **Steps**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/ManogyaDahal/Sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Sorting-algorithm-visualizer
```

3. Build the project using make:
```bash
make
```
After these steps, the project should be built and ready to run.
